# Build-in Validators

<mark style="color:purple;">**Validly**</mark> includes the NuGet package `Validly.Extensions.Validators`, which provides a set of predefined validators for handling common validation scenarios. These built-in validators simplify validation tasks such as checking required fields, enforcing string length constraints, ensuring numeric ranges, validating email formats, and more.

If you notice a missing common validator, feel free to reach out to us or contribute directly by submitting a pull request.
